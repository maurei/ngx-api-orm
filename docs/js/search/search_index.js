It will empower your models with CRUD functionality and also manages to-one and to-many relationships.\nYour models will look something like\n@ResourceModel()\nexport class Employee extends Resource {\n  @ResourceField()\n  public id: number;\n  @ResourceField()\n  public firstName: string;\n  @ResourceField()\n    public lastName: string;\n    @ResourceToOne(Team)\n    public team: ToOneRelation;\n    @ResourceToMany(Task): \n    public tasks: ToManyRelation;\n\n    public mumble(): void {\n        console.log('mumble mumble mumble ....')\n    }\n}\n\n@ResourceModel()\nexport class Task extends Resource {\n  @ResourceField()\n  public id: number;\n  @ResourceField()\n  public title: string;\n}\n\n@ResourceModel()\nexport class Team extends Resource {\n  @ResourceField()\n  public id: number;\n  @ResourceField()\n  public teamName: string;\n}Then, some common usage will look like\n\n/* POST /employees */\nconst john: Employee = await new Employee().save(); /*  All CRUD methods come with type safety. */\n\n/* GET /employees */\nconst employees: Array = await Employee.fetch(); /* Fetches all from API. */\nconst someGuy = employees[0];\nsomeGuy.firstName = 'Mike'\nsomeGuy.mumble()  /* 'mumble mumble mumble ....' */\n\n/* PATCH /employees/{id} */\nawait someGuy.update() /* will only send updated fields */\n\n/* DELETE /employees/{id} */\nawait someGuy.delete()\n\n/* There will also Task and Team instances available if they were included by the response from GET /employees */\nconst tasks: Array = Task.collection();  /* Gets the locally available instances */\n\n/* PATCH /employees/{id}/team  with body {id: 20}  */\nawait someGuy.team.set( Team.find(20)); //* update the to-one relationship */\n\n/* DELETE /employees/{id}/team */\nawait someGuy.team.remove(); //* clear the to-one relationship */\nsomeGuy.team.instance === null  /* Will be true */For more detailed information on the available methods and how to use them, see the model usage guide.\nGetting Started\nInstall the library\nUsing npm:\nnpm install --save-dev @ngx-api-orm/coreImport the library in your module\nimport { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { Resource, JsonApiDotOrg } from '@ngx-api-orm/core';\n\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [ ... ],\n  imports: [ ... ,\n    ResourceModule.forRoot({ \n            rootPath: 'https://example.com/api/v1'\n            requestHandlersProviders: JsonApiDotOrg /* omit this line if you're not using a JsonApi.org formatted API. */\n        }),\n    HttpClientModule, /* this one is required */\n    ... ],\n  providers: [ ...],\n  bootstrap: [ ... ]\n})\nexport class SomeModule {}Write some models\nSee the model usage guide for detailed instructions on how to use the Resource classes and decorators.\nExtend the functionality where needed\nIf the ngx-api-orm default format or the JsonApi.org format is not what you're getting from your API, see the extendability guide.

We will consider an example of three models: Employee, Task and Team. Each Employee belongs to one Team, and an Employee may have multiple Tasks.\n You probably also will need to check the default API format that is assumed for these examples.\nDeclaring models\nStandard declarations\nThe most straight forward way to implement the three models is as below. This example works for this default response example.\n@ResourceModel()\nexport class Employee extends Resource {\n    @ResourceField()\n    public id: number;\n    @ResourceField()\n    public firstName: string;\n    @ResourceField()\n    public lastName: string;\n    @ResourceToOne(Team)\n    public team: ToOneRelation;\n    @ResourceToMany(Task):\n    public tasks: ToManyRelation;\n}\n\n@ResourceModel()\nexport class Task extends Resource {\n    @ResourceField()\n    public id: number;\n    @ResourceField()\n    public title: string;\n}\n\n@ResourceModel()\nexport class Team extends Resource {\n    @ResourceField()\n    public id: number;\n    @ResourceField()\n    public teamName: string;\n}For such models, the following methods will available:\n\nStatic methods: Team.fetch, Team.collection, Team.find, Team.template.\nInstance classes: team.save, team.update, team.delete.\nFor to-one fields: employee.team.set, employee.team.remove, employee.team.sync.\nFor to-many fields: employee.workItems.add, employee.workItems.remove\n\nSee the API docs for detailed specifications of these functions. If you need to know which requests are made exactly and how to change this, see the extendability guide. Some more examples on how to use these methods are included below in the final part of this document.\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\nModels must extend Resource.\nUse the @ResourceField() decorator to link a field to a plain property in the API response.\nthe id field is required and also requires @ResourceField(). It can be a string or number.\nUse @ResourceToOne(TRelated) and  @ResourceToMany(TRelated) to mark fields as to-one and to-many relationships respectively.\nRelationship fields must be of type ToOneRelation or ToManyRelation.\n\nOptional configuration\nPerhaps your model isn't perfectly matching your API response. Some easy fixes can be done in the model. The following model below works with this  default response example with property mismatches.\n@ResourceModel()\nexport class Employee extends Resource {\n    @ResourceField()\n    public id: number;\n    @ResourceField('givenName')\n    public firstName: string;\n    @ResourceField('familyName')\n    public lastName: string;\n    @ResourceToOne(Team)\n    public team: ToOneRelation;\n    @ResourceToMany(Task, 'assignments'):\n    public workItems: ToManyRelation;\n}\n\n@ResourceModel({name: 'WorkItem'}) /* Putting 'work-items' has the same effect'. */\nexport class Task extends Resource {\n    @ResourceField()\n    public id: number;\n    @ResourceField()\n    public title: string;\n}\n\n@ResourceModel()\nexport class Team extends Resource {\n    @ResourceField()\n    public id: number;\n    @ResourceField()\n    public teamName: string;\n}A few things to notice:\n\n@ResourceField('givenName') public firstName: string;will link employee.firstName to employee.givenName  when parsing the API response.\nSimilarly,     @ResourceToMany(Task, 'assignments'): public workItems will look for a assignments property in the API response and treat it as the contents for, in this case, the to-many relationship with Task.\n@ResourceModel({name: 'WorkItem'}) matches the localTask model to a WorkItem resource in the API. This results in for example:\nTask.fetch()  using the url /work-items/.\nemployeeWithId2.tasks.add( ... ) using the url /employees/2/work-items.\nNote the \"s\" in work-itemS. If this were a to-one relation, the url would have singular, i.e. work-item. \n\n\n\nAdding business logic to your models\nYou can add business logic to your class declarations.\n@ResourceModel()\nexport class Employee extends Resource {\n    @ResourceField()\n    public id: number;\n    ...\n    ...\n    public fullName: string;\n    /* Custom request using built-in fetch */\n    public async static fetchWithId(id: number): Promise {\n        const options: HttpClientOptions = {\n            params: new HttpParams().set('id', id)\n            url: '/special-route-override'\n        }\n        const result = await this.fetch(options)\n        return result[0];\n    }\n\n    /* Initialization logic: it is better to leave the constructor alone. */\n    public onInit(rawInstance: RawInstanceTemplate): void {\n        this.fullName = rawInstance.firstName + ' ' + rawInstance.lastName\n    }\n    public complain(): void {\n        console.log('My days are too long...');\n    }\n}\nNote that \n\nYou shouldn't override the constructor unless you know what you're doing. Overloading it wrongly will result in it not working correctly with Angular's dependency injection. Any logic you'd normally put in the constructor can probably go into onInit.\nYou can add fields and methods to your model like you normally would with a class definition.\n\nWorking with instances of your models\nCreating and saving instances\nThere are two ways to create a new instance of your model.\n/* First method, using a raw instance template */\nconst template = Employee.template();  // gets a RawInstanceTemplate object\ntemplate.firstName = 'John';\ntemplate.lastName = 'Williams';\nconst localInstance = new Employee(employeeTemplate);\n\n/* Second method, using no template */\nconst localInstance = new Employee();\nlocalInstance.firstName = 'John';\nlocalInstance.lastName = 'Williams';\n\n/* This will not work */\nconst error = new Employee({firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Williams'})\nIn the first example, a plain object with the public properties of Employee is retrieved. An instance can then be instantiated from this template.\nIn the second example, no template is given. Internally, the constructor will call the static template function to set the properties of the object.\nThe last example will not work because some properties are missing: team and tasks. When passing along a object template, it is required that all fields (the ones that are decorated with ResourceModel,  ResourceToOne and ResourceToMany  are present.\n\nThe local instance can now be saved.\nlocalInstance.id === undefined // true\nEmployee.collection().length === 0 // true\nconst savedInstance = await localInstance.save()\nsavedInstance.id === undefined // false: it should get an id from the API.\nEmployee.collection().length === 0 // false: only instances that have an id are added to the internal collection.\nEmployee.collection().length === 1 // true.\nEmployee.collection()[0] === savedInstance // true\nNote that collection gets the list of available local instances. Only the instances that have an id are included, i.e. unsaved local instances are not in this list.\n\nUpdating and deleting instances\nWe can update and delete instances as follows.\n/* updating */\nconsole.log(employee.firstName) // 'John'\nemployee.firstName = 'Johnny'\nawait localInstance.update() // only sends the fields that are updated, in this case 'firstName'\n\nemployee.lastName = 'Bravo'\nawait localInstance.update() // only sends the fields that are updated, in this case 'lastName'\n\n/* deleting */\nawait employee.delete();\nEmployee.collection().includes(employee) // false\nWhen deleting is complete, the corresponding instance is deleted from the list.\n\nAdding and removing to-one and to-many relations\nIn our example, our Employee instance has a to-one relation with Team and a to-many relation with Task. The related instances of Team and Task are stored in ToOneRelation and ToMany containers, respectively.
